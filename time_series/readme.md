Many practical prediction problems have time component and the seasonality inside these dates has valuable information that cannot be neglected. Time series problems can be categorized into 4 groups, 

1. Univariate (one feature to use in training) and single step (predicting just one point in the future).
2. Multivariate (multiple features to use in training) and single step (predicting just one point in the future).
3- Univariate (one feature to use in training) and multi-step (predicting multiple points in the future).
4- Multivariate (multiple features to use in training) and multi-step (predicting multiple points in the future).
In the following videos I will talk about this groups with simple examples.
