# Time series prediction

Many practical prediction problems have time component and the seasonality inside these dates has valuable information that cannot be neglected. Time series problems can be categorized into 4 groups, 

1. ðŸ’» [Univariate (one feature to use in training) and single step (predicting just one point in the future).](https://youtu.be/LkoSAbKG_H8)
2. ðŸ’» [Multivariate (multiple features to use in training) and single step (predicting just one point in the future).](https://youtu.be/xYT65cyNS4M)
3. Univariate (one feature to use in training) and multi-step (predicting multiple points in the future).
4. Multivariate (multiple features to use in training) and multi-step (predicting multiple points in the future).

Above hyper-links are videos that I describe these groups with simple examples.
