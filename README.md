Creating MVP for ML projects is an interesting topic because it is quick and provides opportunity for engaged partners (managers, clients, etc.) to provide early feedbacks. Those feedbacks can be used later for improving the idea and product development later versions.
In this repo, we will push practical examples of MVPs for different ML projects.
