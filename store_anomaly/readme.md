# Store Anomaly detection
Anomaly detection is an interesting topic in machine learning where you can train models even without labels (unsupervised learning) to detect 
anomalies in the data. This would be great in auditing of finance, predictive maintenance etc. 
where management wants to see problems in current processes and correct them.
